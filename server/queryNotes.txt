How to implement followee_follower?

UPDATE users
SET avatar_id = 9
WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE users
SET initials = 'KKK'
WHERE id = 1;

SELECT count(game_id) 
FROM users 
INNER JOIN avatars ON users.avatar_id = avatars.id 
INNER JOIN user_game ON users.id = user_game.user_id
INNER JOIN games ON user_game.game_id = games.id
WHERE users.id = 1;

gets the guesses
SELECT users.id, user_game.id, row1guess, row2guess
FROM users 
INNER JOIN user_game ON users.id = user_game.user_id
INNER JOIN games ON user_game.game_id = games.id
INNER JOIN guesses ON user_game.id = guesses.user_game_id
WHERE users.id = 1;

UPDATE guesses SET row3guess = 'HAPPY', row3timestamp = NOW() WHERE id = 1;

SELECT user_game.id
FROM users 
INNER JOIN avatars ON users.avatar_id = avatars.id 
INNER JOIN user_game ON users.id = user_game.user_id
INNER JOIN games ON user_game.game_id = games.id
WHERE users.id = 1;

game_id + user_id -> user_game_id

SELECT *
from user_game
WHERE user_id = 2 AND game_id = 2;

INSERT INTO guesses (user_game_id, row1Guess, row1Timestamp) VALUES (3, 'HOUSE', NOW());

select id, user_game_id, row1guess, row1timestamp from guesses;
