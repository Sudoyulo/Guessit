# Guessit
## Lighthouse Labs Final Project

Guessit is a clone of Wordle, a word guessing game. The user has up to six guesses to solve the secret word. Additional features includes a settings sidebar where the user can load and create games and a social tab where users can follow other players. Two other tabs, the help and statistics page, are in the original game.

This game is for fans of the original game Wordle who would like some more social aspects added. Users can now replay past games and compare with friends.

# Project Workflow
Spent the first day discussing which stack we should use, the MVD of the project and stretch goals we would like to work on. Planned the ERD and wireframe to get a clear visual of how to start coding.
Worked on the project by features. Database and frontend were worked on individually. When working in the backend, choose a task that would not cause any merge errors on github. We met twice a day to merge and discuss daily progress.
